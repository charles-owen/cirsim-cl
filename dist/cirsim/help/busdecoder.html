<p>The Bus Decoder component converts a 2 to 4-bit binary value on <strong>In</strong>
	to a true on one of four to sixteen output lines. The number of outputs is determined
	by the bit size and is configurable.</p>

<p>In this figure, a value of 4 (0b100) is decoded to a high on output O4, lighting the corresponding
	LED in an <a href="ledbar.html">LED Bar.</a> The Bus Decoder will also draw a line from the input
to the corresponding activated output. If the input is out of range or undefined, the outputs are
also undefined (?) and the line does not appear.</p>
